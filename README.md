# Speech-to-Text-using-Python-Libraries
This project is a simple Speech-to-Text converter that uses the speech_recognition Python library to transcribe spoken content from .wav audio files into text. The tool leverages Google Web Speech API to perform the transcription and is suitable for basic voice-to-text conversion tasks.
